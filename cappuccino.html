    <p>A cappuccino is an espresso-based coffee drink that originated in Italy and is prepared with steamed milk foam.
        Variations of the drink involve the use of cream instead of milk, using non-dairy milk substitutes and flavoring
        with cinnamon or chocolate powder.</p>
    <p>The name comes from the Capuchin friars, referring to the colour of their habits, and in this context
        referring to the colour of the beverage when milk is added in small portion to dark, brewed coffee (today
        mostly espresso). The physical appearance of a modern cappuccino with espresso créma and steamed milk is a
        result of a long evolution of the drink. </p>
    <p>The Viennese bestowed the name "Kapuziner", possibly in the 18th century, on a version that included whipped
        cream and spices of unknown origin. The Italian cappuccino was unknown outside Italy until the 1930s, and seems
        to be born out of Viennese-style cafés in Trieste and other Italian areas in Austria-Hungary through the
        Kapuziner coffee in the early 20th century. The drink spread from Trieste, the main coffee port in Central
        Europe, throughout Italy, especially after World War I and later worldwide, and can be found at a number of
        establishments. </p>

    <p>Caffè macchiato (Italian pronunciation: [kafˈfɛ mmakˈkja), sometimes called espresso macchiato, is an espresso
        coffee drink with a small amount of milk, usually foamed. In Italian, macchiato means "stained" or "spotted", so
        the literal translation of caffè macchiato is "stained coffee" or "marked coffee".</p>
    <p>The origin of the name "macchiato" stems from baristas needing to show the serving waiters the difference between
        an espresso and an espresso with a tiny bit of milk in it; the latter was "marked". The idea is reflected in the
        Portuguese name for the drink: café pingado, meaning coffee with a drop.</p>
    <p>The caffè macchiato has the highest ratio of espresso to milk of any drink made with those ingredients. The
        intent is that the milk moderates, rather than overwhelms, the taste of the coffee while adding a touch of
        sweetness. The drink is typically prepared by pouring a small amount of steamed milk directly into a single shot
        of espresso.</p>

    <p>A caffè mocha, also called mocaccino, is a chocolate-flavoured warm beverage that is a variant of a caffè latte,
        commonly served in a glass rather than a mug. Other commonly used spellings are mochaccino and also mochachino.
    </p>
    <p>Like café latte, caffè mocha is based on espresso and hot milk but with added chocolate flavouring and sweetener,
        typically in the form of cocoa powder and sugar. Many varieties use chocolate syrup instead, and some may
        contain dark or milk chocolate.</p>
    <p>Caffè mocha, in its most basic formulation, can also be referred to as hot chocolate with (e.g., a shot of)
        espresso added. Like cappuccino, caffè mochas typically contain the distinctive milk froth on top; as is common
        with hot chocolate, they are sometimes served with whipped cream instead. They are usually topped with a dusting
        of either cinnamon, sugar or cocoa powder, and marshmallows may also be added on top for flavour and decoration.
    </p>
    <p>A variant is white caffè mocha, made with white chocolate instead of milk or dark. There are also variants of the
        drink that mix the two syrups; this mixture is referred to by several names, including black-and-white mocha,
        marble mocha, tan mocha, tuxedo mocha, and zebra mocha.

    </p>
    <p>Another variant is a mochaccino which is an espresso shot (double) with either a combination of steamed milk and
        cocoa powder or chocolate milk. Both mochaccinos and caffè mocha can have chocolate syrup, whipped cream and
        added toppings such as cinnamon, nutmeg or chocolate sprinkles.</p>

    <p>A third variant on the caffè mocha is to use a coffee base instead of espresso. The combination would then be
        coffee, steamed milk, and the added chocolate. This is the same as a cup of coffee mixed with hot chocolate. The
        caffeine content of this variation would then be equivalent to the coffee choice included.</p>

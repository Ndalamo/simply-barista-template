    <p>A cortado is a beverage consisting of espresso mixed with a roughly equal amount of warm milk to reduce the
        acidity. The milk in a cortado is steamed, but not frothy and "texturized" as in many Italian coffee drinks. The
        cortado comes from Spain, most likely Madrid, where it is commonly served.</p>
    <p>The word cortado is the past participle of the Spanish verb cortar (to cut), in the sense of "dilute", and can
        refer variously to either coffee or espresso drinks throughout Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries. </p>
    <p>In Spain a café solo corto is a small amount of black coffee (usually a single shot of espresso), while a café
        cortado is an espresso with a splash of milk, while the term cortado is itself broadly associated with various
        coffee or espresso beverages having been "cut" with milk. The café cortado may in fact be interchangeable with
        the Italian macchiato or similar to the French noisette. </p>
    <p>The cortadito in Cuba specifically implies a small beverage similar to the café solo corto consisting of a
        standard 30 mL (1 US fl oz) espresso shot; however, unlike the solo corto, the Cuban cortadito is generally cut
        with heated sweetened condensed milk, being a more available preserved form of milk, whereas fresh milk was
        historically often unavailable. A cortadito is usually served in a special glass, often with a metal ring base
        and a metal wire handle. There are several nominal variations, including cortado condensada, café con leche
        condensada or bombón (espresso with condensed milk); leche y leche is a similar variation, but with both
        condensed milk integrated throughout and a dollop of cream resting on top. Brought to the Little Havana
        neighborhood of Miami, Florida, by Cuban-Americans in the 1960s, the cortadito drink is now found throughout the
        city, and is an important part of everyday culture, particularly among Cubans. However, the cortadito is a drink
        distinct from Cuban-style coffee, which includes sugar in addition to milk, and has its own brewing method as
        espresso.</p>
    <p>In non Spanish-speaking countries where it appears on a specialty coffee menu, however, the cortado should
        generally be distinguished from the Italian caffè macchiato, cappuccino, or a flat white. A macchiato has only a
        small amount (a 'mark' or spot) of milk foam added, while a cappuccino has a head from both foam and milk. A
        flat white is generally made with a similar equivalent ratio of espresso to milk, but uses steamed and textured
        (e.g. microfoam) milk, resulting in a hotter and lighter drink, more closely related to a caffè latte.</p>
    <p>A similar drink in Australia is known as a piccolo latte, or simply a piccolo. This is a single ristretto shot in
        a macchiato glass that is filled with steamed milk in the same fashion as a cafe latte. A larger drink, popular
        in Portugal, is the galão, which uses 1:3 proportions but is otherwise similar to both cortados and manchados.

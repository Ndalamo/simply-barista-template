    <p>Iced coffee is a coffee beverage served cold. It may be prepared either by brewing coffee normally (i.e. carafe,
        French press, etc.) and then serving it over ice or in cold milk, or by brewing the coffee cold. In hot brewing,
        sweeteners and flavoring may be added before cooling, as they dissolve faster. Iced coffee can also be sweetened
        with pre-dissolved sugar in water. </p>
    <p>Pre-packaged iced coffee is available as a grocery item in several countries, though without ice. Iced coffee is
        also regularly available in most coffee shops. Iced coffee is generally brewed at a higher strength than normal
        coffee, given that it is diluted by the melting ice. </p>
    <p>Mazagran, a cold, sweetened coffee beverage that originated in Algeria[1] circa 1840, has been described by
        locals as "the original iced coffee".It was prepared with coffee syrup and cold water.

        Frozen coffee beverages, similar to slush, are documented in the 19th century Similar is the Italian granita al
        caffè.

        Coffee brewed then chilled with ice, called "iced coffee", appears in menus and recipes in the late 19th
        century.

        Iced coffee was popularized by a marketing campaign of the Joint Coffee Trade Publicity Committee of the United
        States in 1920. Much later, it was marketed by chain outlets like Burger King, Dunkin' Donuts and Starbucks.
